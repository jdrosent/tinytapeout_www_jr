{{< youtube eMvZ5xsPXhA >}}

TinyTapeout is an educational project that makes it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip! See what other people are making by taking a look at the latest [data sheet](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-02/raw/tt02/datasheet.pdf).

**Submissions are now closed for Tiny Tapeout 2!**

> **Testimonial** Thank you for doing it - I always wanted to join these OpenMPW shuttles, but never felt ready for it. TinyTapeout provided a way for me to get in, while only spending 1 evening of effort on my end. That's amazing!

> **Testimonial** Just made a 4-bit barrel shifter by using this http://tinytapeout.com toolkit. It's quick and fun to use. The GDS even generated within minutes. Everyone should try this.
